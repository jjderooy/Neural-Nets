# Neural-Nets
This repository contains a functional neural network written in C++ using only standard library types. 
Based on the excellent book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) by Michael Nielsen.

This is not meant to be on the forefront of deep learning technology, rather is for learning about neural networks by programming one!
